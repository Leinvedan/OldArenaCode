# Old arena code
A game made in 2016 when i first started to learn programming. The first version was written in Python (it's a very ugly code, but it's good to see how i have improved so far, so i decided to keep it), the second version is in C#, made almost a year after. This version has some improvements like a graphic interface and some gameplay changes.
